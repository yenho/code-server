`code-server` is [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) running on a remote server, accessible through the browser.

Try it out:
```bash
docker run -p localhost:8443:8443 -v "${PWD}:/root/project" codercom/code-server code-server --allow-http --no-auth
```

- Code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a consistent dev environment.
	- If you have a Windows or Mac workstation, more easily develop for Linux.
- Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go.
	- All intensive computation is ran on your server.
	- You're no longer running excess instances of Chrome.
